* Switch browser tabs

This package is a tiny rewrite of the [[https://github.com/kevinmorio/rofi-switch-browser-tabs][Rofi Switch Browser Tabs]] scripts for Emacs. It removes the need for external dependencies except the small generic wrapi package, and focuses on emacs built-in functionality. For now, it only implements the Chromium Developer Protocol script, which should soon be implemented by firefox-based browsers. PR welcomed for other protocols!

This package relies on the =completing-read= built-in interface, and thus benefits grealty from integration with =consult=, =marginalia=, and =vertico=.

** Chromium-based browsers

*** Installation
1. Install the package using your favorite package manager.
2. Run your browser with the option =--remote-debugging-port=9222=.
3. In Emacs, =M-x switch-browser-tabs=.
