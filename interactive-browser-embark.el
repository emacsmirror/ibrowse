;; Interact with your browser from Emacs

;;; Code:

;; (require 'embark)

;; Ideas for some embark-actions
;; - send the url to embark-become or embark-act as a URL
;; - copy the url
;; DONE kill the tab
;; DONE activate the tab
;; - maybe do something with the tab name, like copy an org-link target ?
